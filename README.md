# JuliaLangProjectHarness

JuliaLangProjectHarness is a JuliaSyntax-native project harness for coding
agents. Its purpose is to help an agent write higher-quality Julia project code:
parser-stable, package-aware, easier for the next agent to understand, and
verified through the same `Pkg.test` loop the package already owns.

This is not a Rust harness port. The Rust harness is an experience source; this
package translates the useful ideas into Julia's own project model:

- `Project.toml` and `Pkg` define package roots, dependency scopes, weakdeps,
  extensions, test targets, local source dependencies, and workspace members.
- `JuliaSyntax.jl` defines syntax facts for policy, search, snapshots, and
  repair advice.
- Literal `include(...)` graphs and package entry modules define practical
  owner boundaries.
- Compact text output is the primary agent surface; JSON remains available for
  tools.
- Self-apply stays active, so new policy must also keep this harness repairable.

## Quality For Agents

The core design target is quality for agents, not a generic style checklist.
The harness makes important Julia project facts visible before an agent edits:

- public API intent through docstrings, exports, `public`, and method families;
- public return contracts when exported methods use concrete return
  annotations;
- public data-shape quality through typed fields and broad abstract field
  annotations;
- public failure contracts when exported methods throw errors or use
  assertions, plus `@test_throws` coverage for those contracts;
- public mutation contracts for `!` APIs, plus package tests that call those
  mutating methods;
- mutable global state through parser-visible non-const package bindings and
  their initializer shape;
- project ownership through Pkg entry files, local source dependencies,
  declared extensions, test owners, includes, and modules;
- algorithm shape through control-flow depth, branch count, loops, pipeline
  calls, and macro-heavy public surfaces;
- test scenario shape through parser-visible testset control-flow, branch, and
  nested-loop facts;
- dependency shape through `[deps]`, `[weakdeps]`, `[extensions]`, `[compat]`,
  `[extras]`, `[targets]`, `[sources]`, and `[workspace]`;
- verification duties through package tests, syntax search, docs/doctests,
  extension boundaries, performance, stress, and chaos task advice;
- policy escape surfaces that require concrete explanations instead of silent
  suppression.

The intended reader of the output is an agent. A Julia package can compile and
still be difficult for an agent to repair safely if intent, ownership,
verification, or domain modeling is hidden in broad stringly code.

## Agent Surfaces

The package exposes several low-noise surfaces:

```julia
using JuliaLangProjectHarness

run_julia_project_harness(pwd())
render_julia_project_harness(run_julia_project_harness(pwd()))
render_julia_project_harness_agent_snapshot(pwd())
render_julia_verification_task_index(build_julia_verification_task_index(pwd()))
search_julia_project(pwd(), "Mode"; tags=["moshi", "method"])
```

The CLI has the same shape:

```sh
julia --project=. bin/julia-project-harness.jl .
julia --project=. bin/julia-project-harness.jl --agent-snapshot .
julia --project=. bin/julia-project-harness.jl --verification-tasks .
julia --project=. bin/julia-project-harness.jl --search route --tag method .
```

Use compact text first when another agent needs to repair the project. Use JSON
modes when a tool needs structured records.

## Rule Packs

Current rule packs are split by intent:

- `julia.syntax`: blocking JuliaSyntax parse failures.
- `julia.project_policy`: blocking package, dependency, extension, test target,
  and scope-policy checks.
- `julia.modularity`: blocking Project.toml-owned Julia owner and include-graph
  checks across source, extension, and test scopes.
- `julia.agent_policy`: advisory repair guidance for agent-friendly Julia APIs,
  tests, docs, data shape, failure contracts, mutation contracts, test scenario
  shape, unsafe evidence, type coverage, Moshi domain modeling, mutable global
  state, and type-piracy risk.

Advisory does not mean cosmetic. It means the package remains runnable while the
harness tells the agent what would make the next repair safer.

## Verification Loop

For this harness repository, use:

```sh
julia --project=. -e 'using Pkg; Pkg.instantiate(); Pkg.test()'
julia --project=. -e 'using Pkg; Pkg.instantiate(); using JuliaLangProjectHarness; assert_julia_project_harness_test_profile_clean(pwd())'
```

`Manifest.toml` is generated locally by `Pkg.instantiate()` and `Pkg.test()`.
This repository is a library-like harness, so the root manifest should not be
committed unless the project policy changes deliberately.

Downstream packages should mount the in-test profile when they depend on this
harness:

```julia
using JuliaLangProjectHarness
using Test

@testset "package" begin
    # package tests
end

assert_julia_project_harness_test_profile_clean(dirname(@__DIR__))
```

That lets `Pkg.test()` show the agent policy findings and verification duties
in the same loop the agent already runs.

## Moshi Extension

Moshi is optional. The harness models it with Julia package extension mechanics:

- root `[weakdeps]` declares `Moshi`;
- `[extensions]` declares `JuliaLangProjectHarnessMoshiExt = "Moshi"`;
- `[targets] test` activates Moshi for package tests;
- core harness code does not require Moshi to load first.

Moshi facts are parser-visible through `@data`, `@match`, and `@derive`.
Stringly branch dispatch is not satisfied by any random Moshi macro: when branch
literals are parser-visible, the Moshi `@data` variants must cover those domain
literals. A covered `@data` model should then be wired into real project logic
with parser-visible `@match` cases or typed methods, so agents use Moshi as a
domain bridge rather than as an unused policy token.

## Documentation Map

Start here:

- `docs/superpowers/research/2026-05-20-julia-project-quality-for-agents.md`
  explains the quality model calibrated from Julia, Pkg, Documenter, and mature
  package practices.
- `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-05-20-julia-syntax-harness-alignment-design.md`
  explains the parser-first harness design and current policy roadmap.

When adding new policy, prefer parser facts first, then compact agent output,
then tests that prove the advice cannot be bypassed by configuration alone.
